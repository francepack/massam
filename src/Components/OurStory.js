      <p>Mason and Samantha first met in 1999 at Camp La Foret. Samantha was a high school aged camp counselor, Mason, an elementary school aged camper.</p>
      <p>Samantha kind of remembers that, but Mason doesn't.</p>
      <p>Samantha and Mason reaquainted several years later through La Foret and First Congregational Church. In the Fall of 2005, Samantha gave Mason a ride to a church committee meeting in Denver. During the 2 hours in the car, they discussed how Mason was thinking about attending Grinnell College, and how Samantha had recently graduated, and felt the college would be a good fit ffor Mason.</p>
      <p>In October 2006, Samantha and Mason officially became friends... on facebook.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Samantha and Mason were counselors together at LaForet, reconnecting them after Mason had finished at Grinnell College.</p>
      <p>Samantha and Mason would proceed to meet up sporadically from 2011 to 2016 at times when Samantha was visiting Denver.</p>
      <p>Mostly, they'd have beers and talk about life and their differing experiences at Grinnell College.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Samantha texted Mason "Yo! Happy Birthday!" to which he replied "Thanks!! Will you be at co at all in the near future??" She, in fact, would. "As a matter of fact, I'm getting back to Colorado tomorrow." He then informed Samantha of the birthday party he was hosting that weekend. She would be arriving in Denver that very day, and decided to attend.</p>
      <p>At that party, Samantha and Mason made out on the dance floor. Who knew that deciding to go to a birthday party would lead Samantha to a husband and baby-daddy?</p>
