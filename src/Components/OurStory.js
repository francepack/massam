      <p>Mason and Samantha first met in 1999 at Camp La Foret. Samantha was a high school aged camp counselor, Mason, an elementary school aged camper.</p>
      <p>Samantha kind of remembers that, but Mason doesn't.</p>
      <p>Samantha and Mason reaquainted several years later through La Foret, and First Congregational church. Put on a comittee together in Denver, Samantha and Mason had an hour long car ride both ways to discuss how Mason was thinking about attending Grinnell College, and how Samantha just had graduated, and thought it would be a good fit.</p>
      <p>In October 2006, Samantha and Mason officially became 'Friends'... on facebook.</p>
      <p>Samantha and Mason connected sporadically from 2010 to 2016 when Samantha was visiting Denver.</p>
      <p>Mostly, they'd have beers, talk about life, and their differing experiences at Grinnell College.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Samantha texted Mason "Happy Birthday!" to which he replied "Thanks!" He then informed Samantha of a party he was hosting in several days. She would in fact be arriving in Denver that very day, and decided to attend.</p>
      <p>Who knew that deciding to go to a birthday party would lead Samantha to a husband and baby-daddy?</p>
